* As the proud owner of the gym, I want to have data of traffic in my gym, including what's being used and the frequency of use.  This will help me make more informed business decisions.
  
* As a patron/customer of the gym, I want to know what machines/areas are occupied and which ones are vacant.  This will help me save time in my workout and prevent me from losing time waiting in lines for equipment.
  
* As a developer of the product, I want to be able to smoothly capture gym traffic and extrapolate the data into information for my customers, and my customer's customers.  This will help sell the product.
