# Project Constraints Summary

Our project, which uses cameras and machine learning to track gym equipment usage, faces several constraints. **Legally**, recording in gyms requires compliance with privacy laws and user consent to avoid unauthorized surveillance. **Socially**, our project aims to benefit gym-goers by providing real-time equipment availability, enhancing their workout experience. **Security** concerns include protecting video data from breaches and implementing safeguards for any associated user information on our website. Lastly, **Economic** limitations mean we’re relying on personal funds, primarily for a camera and open-source software, so we’ll focus on creating a cost-effective prototype that meets these constraints.
