## Co-op Work Experience
In my five co-op experiences at UC, I have developed a variety of skills that could be applied in different environments and applications. During my first two co-op experiences, I worked closely with IT architects on application deployment, where I became familiar with corporate hardware and software, and I resolved countless issues in a support setting. In my third co-op, I created a prototype for a product to be implemented into commercial gyms, working on configuring the hardware and coding the back-end. In my final two co-op experiences, I took on a project management role, where I learned the delicate trades of delegation, communication, and leadership. I led a final project at the end of my 6-months with the company by organizing regular meetings with Procter & Gamble to ensure their data was safely migrated to the company's SharePoint.

## Project Sought
I am looking to create something, perhaps a product, that will solve a problemâ€”ideally something that integrates artificial intelligence and data gathering. Gaining hands-on experience in these areas would be super valuable to me. I want to create something impactful that could inspire change. It could be anything.
