### Project Description:

The Gym Equipment Usage Monitoring System is designed to enhance the user experience in gyms by utilizing video feeds to monitor equipment availability. The system identifies whether individuals are standing or sitting near specific gym equipment and tracks their usage in real-time. When a person is detected using a machine, the system updates a database to mark that equipment as in use, allowing gym-goers to see which machines are occupied without having to walk over. Conversely, when no one is detected in the vicinity, the system updates the status to indicate that the equipment is free. This information is made accessible through a user-friendly front-end website, enabling gym members to check equipment availability from anywhere in the gym. By integrating video analysis and a responsive database, this system aims to improve gym efficiency and user satisfaction
