# Tasklist

1. **Research machine learning models** for detecting human presence on gym equipment using image data. *(Assigned: Parker & Josh)*

2. **Specify the list of gym equipment** to be monitored and outline how they will be visually distinguished. *(Assigned: Josh)*

3. **Design the system architecture** that integrates camera feeds, the machine learning model, and the web interface. *(Assigned: Josh)*

4. **Investigate optimal camera placement** to ensure each piece of gym equipment is fully visible for accurate detection. *(Assigned: Parker)*

5. **Develop a Python script** to capture images from the camera feed in real-time. *(Assigned: Parker)*

6. **Train a machine learning model** to classify gym equipment as either in-use or idle based on camera footage. *(Assigned: Josh)*

7. **Obtain sample images** of gym equipment in different states (in-use vs. idle) to train the model. *(Assigned: Parker & Josh)*

8. **Create a database schema** to store equipment usage data and user interactions. *(Assigned: Josh)*

9. **Design the front-end of the website** where users can see real-time updates on gym equipment usage. *(Assigned: Parker)*

10. **Develop a Flask backend** to handle the communication between the machine learning model, the database, and the web interface. *(Assigned: Parker)*

11. **Test the accuracy** of the machine learning model using validation datasets for different lighting conditions and camera angles. *(Assigned: Josh)*

12. **Validate camera connectivity** to ensure stable live feeds into the system at all times. *(Assigned: Josh)*

13. **Refine the machine learning model** based on testing results, improving detection rates for edge cases. *(Assigned: Parker)*

14. **Implement a real-time update system** on the website to show current gym equipment usage dynamically. *(Assigned: Parker)*

15. **Create user login functionality** to allow gym members to check equipment availability on the website. *(Assigned: Parker)*

16. **Test the full system** by simulating gym conditions with multiple users on various equipment. *(Assigned: Josh)*

17. **Document the final machine learning model** setup and the data preprocessing steps. *(Assigned: Josh)*

18. **Develop a notification system** to alert users when certain gym equipment becomes available. *(Assigned: Josh)*

19. **Design an admin panel** for gym staff to monitor equipment status and camera feeds. *(Assigned: Parker)*

20. **Refine the website UI** based on user feedback, optimizing for mobile and desktop users. *(Assigned: Parker)*

21. **Validate the system under peak usage times** when the gym is crowded, ensuring real-time updates remain fast and accurate. *(Assigned: Josh)*

22. **Prepare final project documentation** outlining system architecture, development steps, and deployment instructions. *(Assigned: Parker & Josh)*
