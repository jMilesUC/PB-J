# Project Timeline and Milestones and Effort Matrix

## Milestones List
1. **Research & Planning Phase**  
   - Research machine learning models for detecting human presence on gym equipment.
   - Specify gym equipment to be monitored and distinguish visually between them.
   - Design system architecture for camera feeds, the ML model, and the web interface.
   - Investigate optimal camera placements for visibility and accuracy.
   
2. **Data Collection & Model Training**  
   - Develop a Python script to capture real-time images from the camera feed.
   - Collect sample images of gym equipment in various states (in-use, idle).
   - Train the machine learning model for equipment classification based on collected data.
   
3. **System Development**  
   - Design a database schema to store usage data and interactions.
   - Build the front-end website to display real-time gym equipment usage.
   - Develop a Flask backend to handle data communication.
   
4. **Testing & Refinement**  
   - Test the machine learning model for accuracy in various lighting conditions.
   - Validate stable camera connectivity for live feeds.
   - Refine the model and enhance detection rates for edge cases.
   
5. **Feature Implementation**  
   - Implement real-time updates on the website for equipment status.
   - Add user login functionality to view equipment availability.
   - Create a notification system for equipment availability updates.
   
6. **System Validation & Finalization**
